# Codvid-19 Tracker

This application is a basic **Corona Virus** tracker.

#### What it does ?

Basically the user will enter or search for a specific location (mostly a country) for now !
Then the app uses procided data from an **API** to get the information and show it back to the User.

The basic or first version will only search for a country but later maybe there will other upgraded features.
Which allow the user to search for specific cities or even specific data.
